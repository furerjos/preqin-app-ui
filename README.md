Hi, I'm Joshua Furer. I hope you enjoy this small app. 

This is the frontend for my technical round interviewing for Preqin. 

Front-end:
1. React.ts with Next.js (I like Next.js' layout and page routing simplicity)
2. Separate repository from back-end (Best practice to keep isolated, for debugging purposes and scalability)
3. External CSS (personal choice, easy to keep everything consistent in my opinion)
